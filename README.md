# Smart-Student-Card-Management
This Project is designed and developed to serve one of the major jobs inside a campus. During the development, we considered the drawbacks of conventional identification systems. The conventional system uses different kinds of identifications system like medical cards, library cards, etc, also there is no digital system to manage these sections of the campus, as well as the cafeteria. We analyzed these problems and tried to figure out how we can reduce the problem with a digital system and an all-in-one Student Card. Therefore, we decided to develop this project. We are highly hopeful that this project can reduce the problem of conventional systems. It offers a centralized system that provides functionalities to identify Students Using only one identification Card and serve their needs more efficiently.
